## How to play 
Go face to face with Jack Black in Blackjack. 

Blackjack is a game where you try to get a total card value of 21, or at least closer to it than Jack Black, without going over 21 (going over 21 is known as a "Bust". Jack gets to keep one card face down so you can't tell what the total value of his cards are. As soon as you are done adding cards to your hand (each time you do this you are "Hitting") to try and get 21 or close to it, he flips his face-down card over and then takes another card until he has 17 or higher. So while he does have the advantage of you not seeing both of his cards, he has to continue hitting until he gets to 17. You should strategically base your decisions to hit, based on the face-up card you can see in Jack Black's hand. 

If someone is dealt a 21 in the first two cards, then they automatically win with Jack Black. I mean Blackjack.
