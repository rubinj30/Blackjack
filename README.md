## How to play 
Go face to face (literally if you upload your photo in the left sidebar) with Jack Black in Blackjack. 

Blackjack is a game where you try to get a total card value of 21, or at least closer to it than Jack Black, without going over 21 (going over 21 is known as a "Bust". Jack gets to keep one card face down so you can't tell what the total value of his cards are. As soon as you are done adding cards to your hand (each time you do this you are "Hitting") to try and get 21 or close to it, he flips his face-down card over and then takes another card until he has 17 or higher. So while he does have the advantage of you not seeing both of his cards, he has to continue hitting until he gets to 17. You should strategically base your decisions to hit, based on the face-up card you can see in Jack Black's hand. 

If someone is dealt a 21 in the first two cards, then they automatically win with Jack Black. I mean Blackjack. 

## Technologies used

- Flexbox
- Materialize

## Future development
- Add in betting on each hand with set chip values, and eventually a value taken from input
- Add API call for weather widgets showing current weather to popular gambling destinations
- Maybe add flight price widgets, too
- Make Ace having the option of being a 1 or 11
- add fancier alert windows using modals
- display odds 
- if 5 cards are dealt to player but they haven't busted, they automatically win 
- REFACTOR! should end with MVC model
- Prompt user for name
- Connect to PayPal and Bitcoin and allow for real gambling
- add sound bites and more customization specific to Jack Black
