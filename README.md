## Background
This was my first project for my Web Development course at General Assembly. 

## What I learned
- Planning ahead and focusing on user stories will pay off in the end
- How Object-Oriented Programming can be very beneficial for larger projects
- Became comfortable with manipulating the DOM
- Put out a working product and not be afraid to do major refactoring to clean up, make it more efficient, or add new features

## Technologies/Frameworks used
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Materialize
- HTML/CSS

## Future development
- Add API calls for weather widgets showing current weather to popular gambling destinations
- Maybe add flight price widgets, too
- Option to display odds
- Animations for cards sliding in and out
- if 5 cards are dealt to player but they haven't busted, they automatically win 
- Connect to PayPal and Bitcoin and allow for real gambling
- add sound bites and more customization specific to Jack Black 
- Re-write entirely with React
